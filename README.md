### Estimated gun sales from background checks
To estimate gun sales using background checks, I used a method suggested by [The Small Arms Survey] by Jurgen Brauer and the New York Times.(http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/F-Working-papers/SAS-WP14-US-Firearms-Industry.pdf)  Every handgun and long gun check was counted as 1.1 sale and every multiple gun check was counted as two sales.

I omitted permit checks, prepawn and other types of checks.  The "multiple" category in Califiorna was also omiited due the fact there is only data from December 2005 to August of 2008.
